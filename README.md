# SONIC - Sound-Oriented Network-Information-Channel  
## What is SONIC?  
SONIC is an application for transferring data over audio. Your data gets encoded, and instead of transferring over radio waves, SONIC uses sound waves so that both you and your computer can experience the transfer  

## How to use  
To run SONIC, you need two Python clients, one to be the transmitter, and one to be the receiver. When the receiver has started listening, the sender can start their transmission, and SONIC handles the rest.
